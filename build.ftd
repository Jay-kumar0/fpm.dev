-- ft.h0: `fpm build`

`fpm build` is used to convert `.ftd` files in a fpm package into static HTML
files. The generated HTML files can be uploaded on github-pages, S3 etc to publish
your `ftd` files.


-- ft.h1: Regarding Dynamic Features in FTD

`ftd` files can be dynamic, say they can refer an HTTP endpoint, from where `ftd`
will fetch the content, say JSON, and pass it to `ftd` document. This happens
during rendering, if you use the planned `fpm serve`, or if the `fpm package` is
published to a `fpm-repo`.

When using `fpm build`, the dynamic stuff happens during the build time, and
subsequently a static version is only available.

`fpm build` is only to support the use case where you do not have ability to run
custom application (`fpm-repo`) and do not want to depend on SAAS version, and want
to use static file serving to host your website.


-- ft.h1: `.build` folder

The generated HTML files are stored in `.build` folder, which is found next to the
`FPM.ftd` file, in the `package root`. For now this is not configurable.


-- ft.h1: `.packages` folder

`fpm build` also downloads all the dependencies specified in the `FPM.ftd` file and
stores in `.packages` folder.
