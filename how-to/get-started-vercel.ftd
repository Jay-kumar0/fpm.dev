-- ft.h0: Getting started with Vercel

Vercel is an incredibly easy to use tool which helps you build and ship your
websites with an easy to use interface. You can get started with a fresh
repository (step 1) or you can deploy your existing repository (step 2).

-- ft.h1: Step 1. Choosing the source of your deployment

-- ft.h2: Step 1.1. Start from scratch: New Repository

Use this [template](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/fifthtry/fpm-blog&template=other)
to initialize. Check out step 2 for the configuration setup.

-- ft.h2: Step 1.2. Deploy an existing repository

Deploying an existing FPM repository on vercel is quite easy. On your vercel
dashboard, click on [New Project](https://vercel.com/new) and select your git
provider and the repository accordingly.

Once done, you'll be taken to the Configuration Dashboard of the application.
Select the `FRAMEWORK PRESET` as Other and enter the configuration mentioned in
Step 2.
