They have mapped more than one names to\nsame code in a few cases, which I feel is actually a good thing, we can be more\nprecise in language name, honour the preference of the author, we are interested\nin the code, which we will get.\n\nSo this is our first decision. We will proper case also, so `language: Gujarati`\nas it is proper noun, and not `language: gujarati`.\n\nThen the other problem is how to show the name of language in language detail\npage in a form native speakers of that language can understand, so \"ગુજરાતી\" we\nshould show.

Say you want something that implements\n`fpm.dev/blog`, and you found `Jay/Fancy-Blog-Theme`. Now `Jay/Fancy-Blog-Theme`\nmay implement more than just `fpm.dev/blog`. It may implement other packages.\nAlso `Jay/Fancy-Blog-Theme` may define some components that are not part of\n`fpm.dev/blog`, which means if you used them, switching to another theme would\nbecome hard as that other theme may not implement `Jay/Fancy-Blog-Theme`.\n\nSo we do not want to access all modules and symbols of a package, we want to\nconstraint what modules and symbols are \"visible\" to us. We can do that using\nproposed `implements` syntax:",

But it has a problem: it\nallows people to now provide arbitrary CSS file, there is no way to check the\ncontent of the target file to ensure it only contains `@font-face` declarations, it\ncan contain any CSS, and it becomes a way for people to include CSS in FTD files.\n\nThis is a problem because FTD is designed with multiple target support, we\ncurrently compile FTD to HTML/CSS/JS, but in future we will compile to Swift code\nor Kotlin etc for mobile devices, or C code for ncurses based terminal UI support\nand so on. We are taking inspiration from CSS, the attributes for example, but\nthat's it, those attributes will have equivalent in Android/nCurses etc, or we will\ntry to degrade gracefully.\n\nIf we allow CSS then suddenly our layout kernels can be misused to give arbitrary\nlayouts, and suddenly FTD files won't be compatible with our future FTD rendering\ntargets.

    "value": "15th Dec 2021\n\n\nWhen referring to a document, we use a document id. The document id for a document\nin current package is the relative path from package root. If we are referring to\na document from another package, we use `<package-name>:<document-name>`, the colon\nseparated path.\n\nOn its own if you see `x`, it can either be a document in current package, you may\nask why no `x.ftd`? Are we allowing `x/index.ftd` to be referred to by `x`? No. Our\n`index.ftd` is only special at package root level, and not at individual folder\nlevel, we follow `x.ftd` and `x/y.ftd` convention and do not fall back to\n`x/index.ftd`, `x/y.ftd` as say node etc do. There are advantages to fall back, eg\nwhole of `/x/*` is in a folder `x`, this leads to some simplicity, eg if you want\nto ignore that path, you have to no ignore `x/` folder as well as `x.ftd` file.\n\nWe also have complications around import path in ftd documents vs file paths on\ncommand line. If you want to import `x.ftd` you write `-- import: x`, without the\nextension. Does that mean when you want to refer to `x.ftd` anywhere in FPM context\nit must be `x`? Like on command line if you want to add tracking on `x.ftd` or sync\n`x.ftd` do you use `x` or `x.ftd`?\n\nWe can have a rule, if only ftd file is meaningful in any context, eg in import\nstatement, you can not import a `.txt` file, but you can track `.txt` file, so if\nonly `.ftd` is allowed for something we use the path without `.ftd` extension and\nany file can be passed we use the extension.\n\nWe can also standardise on file vs document terminology. Document in FPM context\nstrictly means it is a FTD file, where as file means any file. So function names,\nparameters etc can use `print_file()` or `print_document()` etc naming convention.\n\nThere is one more complexity. Say you have a `logo.png` file, there can also be a\n`logo.png.ftd` file which contains the meta data or web index of the `logo.png`. We\ncan argue that this is too much complexity and lets have no such special\nconvention. For example this causes another complexity as to what should be the URL\nof such `logo.png.ftd` file? The URL of `logo.png` is `/logo.png` if it is at\npackage root, but for `x.ftd` the URL is `/x/` so with this logic the URL of\n`logo.png.ftd` would be `/logo.png/`, and having different content based on\npresence or absence of a trailing `/` in URL seems to be a bad idea. Or maybe we do\nit based on \"accept\" header, if you request an HTML for `/logo.png` you get the\ncontent of `logo.png.ftd` and if you request image you get the `.png`. But then how\nwould you link to the file? Say you want to open an image in a new tab?",

There are advantages to fall back, eg\nwhole of `/x/*` is in a folder `x`, this leads to some simplicity, eg if you want\nto ignore that path, you have to no ignore `x/` folder as well as `x.ftd` file.\n\nWe also have complications around import path in ftd documents vs file paths on\ncommand line. If you want to import `x.ftd` you write `-- import: x`, without the\nextension. Does that mean when you want to refer to `x.ftd` anywhere in FPM context\nit must be `x`? Like on command line if you want to add tracking on `x.ftd` or sync\n`x.ftd` do you use `x` or `x.ftd`?\n\nWe can have a rule, if only ftd file is meaningful in any context, eg in import\nstatement, you can not import a `.txt` file, but you can track `.txt` file, so if\nonly `.ftd` is allowed for something we use the path without `.ftd` extension and\nany file can be passed we use the extension.\n\nWe can also standardise on file vs document terminology. Document in FPM context\nstrictly means it is a FTD file, where as file means any file. So function names,\nparameters etc can use `print_file()` or `print_document()` etc naming convention.\n\nThere is one more complexity. Say you have a `logo.png` file, there can also be a\n`logo.png.ftd` file which contains the meta data or web index of the `logo.png`. We\ncan argue that this is too much complexity and lets have no such special\nconvention. For example this causes another complexity as to what should be the URL\nof such `logo.png.ftd` file? The URL of `logo.png` is `/logo.png` if it is at\npackage root, but for `x.ftd` the URL is `/x/` so with this logic the URL of\n`logo.png.ftd` would be `/logo.png/`, and having different content based on\npresence or absence of a trailing `/` in URL seems to be a bad idea. Or maybe we do\nit based on \"accept\" header, if you request an HTML for `/logo.png` you get the\ncontent of `logo.png.ftd` and if you request image you get the `.png`. But then how\nwould you link to the file? Say you want to open an image in a new tab?",

So I have been thinking about `fpm update` recently\nand came across [nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr) that implements something\nvery close to what I had in mind.\n\nI kind of consider `nostr` design the right design, good balance between\ncentralised (prone to attacks, censorship etc) and \"pure\" peer to peer (complex,\nless reliable etc). Maybe there are issues, but to me it sounds good.\n\nSo we know how to distribute packages. What is missing is package identity. Package\nnames depend on DNS if you buy your own domain, and with others, eg github if you\nhost on `<username>.github.io` etc. So how do we ensure you really own the package\nidentity? That you can move from `.github.io` to something else without losing\npeople who may be interested in your content.\n\nTraditional way requires you to do a redirect from old to new. But this relies on\nold service still running, often companies come and go, domain can expire or sold\nto someone with no interest in honouring the old contracts.\n\nIf not domain name then what? One candidate is cryptographic keys. But they are too\nhard, at least when you are targeting billions of publishers, like Twitter and\nFacebook does. Eventually your FPM packages should be your twitter/Facebook\nprofile, but how do you manage identity?\n\nWhatsApp etc, E2E, End To End-Encryption systems rely on some shared identity, eg\na phone number of email address as a convenience, and then they generate some keys\nbehind the scenes, you can see the fingerprint of your keys in whatsapp for\nexample, and verify each others identity (phone number appears to be the identity\nfrom the layman's perspective, but its backed by strong cryptographic foundations).\n\nSo let me repeat, when you are sending a message on WhatsApp, you think you are\nsending it to a phone number, but WhatsApp has internally exchanged some encryption\nkeys with that contact, and its going to that key.\n\nLet me say it in a more formal way, in PKI, whatever that might be, anyone can\ngenerate a key pair, a private key and a public key. This key pair can be\nconsidered an identity. When you send a message it goes to someone, that someone\nneeds to be identified, and how we identify them can be considered their identity.\nWhat you can do is encrypt the message with the public key of the recipient, and\nonly the corresponding private key can de-crypt the message.\n\nSo in this sense, a key pair can be your identity. But key pairs are just numbers,\nand unlike phone numbers, they are much bigger. So exchanging these numbers is not\nfun, it's opaque, no one can remember them, nor can see what they are referring to\nif we see a huge number representing a public key in someone's `FPM.ftd` file as a\ndependency.\n\nSo we need a way for the key pair to get an alias. The domain name is a good alias.\nIf we tread DNS as alias, not the source of truth, things are much better. Identity\nmoves are rare, but they do happen. People switch providers, people may want to\nmove from Github Pages to another service, and back. Once someone starts following\nsomeone, such moves should not affect them, the followers should continue to get\nupdates despite name changes. So how do we achieve this with PKI and aliases?\n\nImagine Github Pages implemented our protocol, this is how it could work. They\ngenerate a key pair for you when you sign up. This is important if we want\nbillions of people to use services. Most people are not going to want to bother\nwith all this. This is what WhatsApp/Telegram do to deliver strong cryptographic\nguarantees (at least by design/promise, implementation is another matter) to\nmasses.\n\nSo when you create an account on any of these services, they create a new unique\nidentity (key pair) for you. You start using that service, you gain followers,\nand say you get serious. This is the point you will bother with all this identity\nbusiness details. Now you have say 100s of followers and you want to move to a\ndifferent provider, without losing the followers (without breaking 100s/thousands\nof packages that depend on breaking).\n\nAt this point you will now claim your identity. You install another app, offline\nonly for strictest guarantees, and generate your real identity, real key pair.\n\nNow if Github Pages etc are acting in good faith, they will let everyone know that\nthey are temporary guardians of your identity, that you have not yet claimed your\nidentity, and the moment you do so they will cooperate. If they chose to act in\nbad faith, charge you money for you to claim your identity or not let you do it\nwhile initially promising that they will, then you could lose follower, but\nhopefully word will spread and people will shun such services.\n\nSo the temporary guardian of your identity can accept your real identity keys,\nand everyone who is following your via `<username>.github.io` now learns of your\ntrue identity as well (and that Github is an intermediary working for you for now,\nvia you signing the Github generated keypair with your real identity).\n\nSo real identity has always been the keypair, but we would be using the domain\nname. We need a distributed store of keypair to DNS mapping, so you can switch\nthe domain for your keypair. Some sort of \"key server\" is needed. Your followers\nwhere initially thinking that the Github generated keypair was the true identity,\nbut since you update your identity, github will notify them about the true\nidentity and your FPM will now store the true identity of what you are following.\n\nWe also will have to allow for \"key revocation\", say one of the guardians went\nrogue, got bought out, hacked etc, and starts sending updates on your behalf to\nyour followers, you had signed that key-pair with your key, so now you have to\nrevoke that key-pair. The key-server can do that as well.\n\nSo the protocol is: in `FPM.ftd` you see domains. You keep a cache of domain to\nkeypair id on your file system. Periodically you check with key-server if the\ndomain for any keypair has changed, if so `fpm` commands start reporting warnings\nthat domain entries are out of date, please update ASAP. `fpm` can now chose to,\nif you so want, start using the latest entries from key-server for the\nidentities, so say if dependencies say you are publishing on\n`<username>.github.io`, but since `key-server` says domain moved to\n`<username>.com`, `fpm` will start fetching from `<username>.com`.",

So I have been thinking about `fpm update` recently\nand came across [nostr](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr) that implements something\nvery close to what I had in mind.\n\nI kind of consider `nostr` design the right design, good balance between\ncentralised (prone to attacks, censorship etc) and \"pure\" peer to peer (complex,\nless reliable etc). Maybe there are issues, but to me it sounds good.\n\nSo we know how to distribute packages. What is missing is package identity. Package\nnames depend on DNS if you buy your own domain, and with others, eg github if you\nhost on `<username>.github.io` etc. So how do we ensure you really own the package\nidentity? That you can move from `.github.io` to something else without losing\npeople who may be interested in your content.\n\nTraditional way requires you to do a redirect from old to new. But this relies on\nold service still running, often companies come and go, domain can expire or sold\nto someone with no interest in honouring the old contracts.\n\nIf not domain name then what?

    "value": "So we recently introduced this command, and currently it simply re-downloads all\nthe dependencies, which is fine for our demos and initial usability testing etc,\nbut clearly not something we want to eventually.\n\nWe are designing FPM infra to be as \"distributed\" as possible, this means we can\nnot have a central entity knowing the status of all the packages as is done by many\nother package managers.\n\nWe can poll, re-fetch each `<dependency>/FPM.ftd`, with etag handling etc, but this\nis still not great. How often to poll? On every `fpm` command invocation? Every\nminute/hr/day? Every time user says `fpm update`?\n\nSure. We can come up with some such scheme. But can we have some sort of middle\nground? Not central, yet we do not have to poll everyone? Poll is not great, we\nwant push, as soon as the package we are interested in is updated, say I opened my\nlaptop for a few minutes before catching a long flight, I would want my system to\nautomatically fetch all the latest updates. If in the last minute before I close\nthe lid there was an update to a package, I would want that to be available to me.\n\nPosing problem like this, no central, and yet want push, means we create a few, a\nfew hundred, thousand maybe \"central\" agents. Say there is a new component\n`fpm bastion`, probably using that word incorrectly, some sort of `fpm aggregator`,\nand say each package can pick say 10 of such aggregators. People can maintain fpm\naggregator lists, some will be available via `fpm.dev`, but say its down, under\nattack, sold out, there are others lists, and each package may include a list of\naggregators they know of so one can look at all aggregators from all the package\nthey currently have.\n\nSo there are so many aggregators. And they themselves are chatter boxes, gossiping\nwith each other. For each package they keep track of the `FPM.ftd` file. We can\nalways use public key infrastructure to ensure the `FPM.ftd` file I receive from\nan aggregator is trustworthy (they can lie about not giving me the latest update,\nbut they can not modify `FPM.ftd` without getting trivially detected).\n\nEach FPM package should pick a dozen or so aggregators from the list. And every\ntime there is an update, every time `fpm sync` runs, the content is uploaded to\n`fpm-repo` but also sent to aggregators.\n\nAggregators are chattering and they will communicate to others if any change has\nhappened. Aggregators may even be paid to give guarantees that they talk to\neveryone or that they have strong latency guarantees (the gap between an update\nhappening on any aggregator in world to this aggregator telling you it has\nhappened).\n\nWe will have to employ many techniques from distributed hash table literature and\nprior work.

    "value": "So we recently introduced this command, and currently it simply re-downloads all\nthe dependencies, which is fine for our demos and initial usability testing etc,\nbut clearly not something we want to eventually.\n\nWe are designing FPM infra to be as \"distributed\" as possible, this means we can\nnot have a central entity knowing the status of all the packages as is done by many\nother package managers.\n\nWe can poll, re-fetch each `<dependency>/FPM.ftd`, with etag handling etc, but this\nis still not great. How often to poll? On every `fpm` command invocation? Every\nminute/hr/day? Every time user says `fpm update`?\n\nSure. We can come up with some such scheme. But can we have some sort of middle\nground? Not central, yet we do not have to poll everyone? Poll is not great, we\nwant push, as soon as the package we are interested in is updated, say I opened my\nlaptop for a few minutes before catching a long flight, I would want my system to\nautomatically fetch all the latest updates. If in the last minute before I close\nthe lid there was an update to a package, I would want that to be available to me.\n\nPosing problem like this, no central, and yet want push, means we create a few, a\nfew hundred, thousand maybe \"central\" agents. Say there is a new component\n`fpm bastion`, probably using that word incorrectly, some sort of `fpm aggregator`,\nand say each package can pick say 10 of such aggregators. People can maintain fpm\naggregator lists, some will be available via `fpm.dev`, but say its down, under\nattack, sold out, there are others lists, and each package may include a list of\naggregators they know of so one can look at all aggregators from all the package\nthey currently have.\n\nSo there are so many aggregators. And they themselves are chatter boxes, gossiping\nwith each other. For each package they keep track of the `FPM.ftd` file. We can\nalways use public key infrastructure to ensure the `FPM.ftd` file I receive from\nan aggregator is trustworthy (they can lie about not giving me the latest update,\nbut they can not modify `FPM.ftd` without getting trivially detected).\n\nEach FPM package should pick a dozen or so aggregators from the list. And every\ntime there is an update, every time `fpm sync` runs, the content is uploaded to\n`fpm-repo` but also sent to aggregators.\n\nAggregators are chattering and they will communicate to others if any change has\nhappened. Aggregators may even be paid to give guarantees that they talk to\neveryone or that they have strong latency guarantees (the gap between an update\nhappening on any aggregator in world to this aggregator telling you it has\nhappened).\n\nWe will have to employ many techniques from distributed hash table literature and\nprior work. Maybe even use [IPFS etc](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs) and\nnot re-invent things.\n\nOr we can go old fashioned, sort of reverse mail relay, DNS for any domain (or\ncurrent version of FPM.ftd if its not too old) can tell you the preferred\naggregator for this package. We can also do the aggregator push, like my preferred\naggregators are say this list, then when I am fetching a package from your\n`fpm-repo`, I can tell the repo about that list, and tell `fpm-repo` to notify to\none of my preferred aggregators.\n\nAnyways, so we have a bunch of aggregators, or we have full blown IPFS infra,\nwhatever.

The thing is we did
not discuss a “default” exports for every “package interface”, nor are we using
the planned <code>implements</code> syntax yet. The idea is when you import a dependency,
you may want to use it only because it implements the package interface of a
package you are interested in. Say you want something that implements
<code>fpm.dev/blog</code>, and you found <code>Jay/Fancy-Blog-Theme</code>. Now <code>Jay/Fancy-Blog-Theme</code>
may implement more than just <code>fpm.dev/blog</code>. It may implement other packages.
Also <code>Jay/Fancy-Blog-Theme</code> may define some components that are not part of
<code>fpm.dev/blog</code>, which means if you used them, switching to another theme would

common Python modules, e.g. <code>np</code> for <code>numpy</code>, <code>pd</code> for <code>panda</code>, <code>plt</code> for
<code>matplotlib</code> are almost universally recognizable. We are creating <strong>few</strong> such
aliases, <code>book</code>, <code>post</code>, etc, which we hope to similarly become universally
recognizable, and so this magic is acceptable. Creating a consistent naming, so
any <code>ftd</code> document you come across in wild can be easily copy-paste-able in your
project is easily achieved by this. You will always know what <code>book</code> is if you
come across it anywhere, and can quickly pick from a huge number of themes that
are implementing <code>book</code>.</p>

This
is the core to how we pass data from FTD to “host”. We similarly need a “special
variable” <code>$VALUE</code>, which will be available only in <code>$event-change$</code> handlers,
so we can do <code>$event-change$: $query = $VALUE</code>, assuming we already have a
variable defined: <code>-- optional string query:</code>. These are easy bits.</p>

In FTD the DOM structure is rendered by Rust code,
and from front-end we can only modify some variables, variables that show-hide
an existing DOM node, or change some attribute of existing DOM node. This is why
we have to make every field conditional individually, we have to update our JS
to change the DOM node.</p>

<p data-id="0,0,0,10,1,2:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>What we have to do now is an ability to generate DOM node in front-end now.
Search is going to fetch search result from some service, and we have to create
a child corresponding to each search result. We can do a hacky thing, pre-create
say 10 DOM nodes, because we know the page is going to have 10 search results
only, but this is not a great answer, say consider if we had tree, with up-to 4
level, we will have to pre-create 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 DOM nodes.</p>

component definitions from front-end. We will pass a specification of components
that are needed dynamically (we do a dynamic variable dependency analysis
already). And then we will write some JavaScript code in <code>ftd.js</code> to create DOM
based on the component spec, and the data (it will happen every time the data
changes).</p>

still quite low compared to other JS library standards, our current <code>ftd.js</code> is
only 3.3KB gzipped, it will barely increase it to 10KB at worst. This will
increase the amount of JSON we include in page, as now the specification of all
the components used dynamically will also be included. Our compresses <code>index.html</code>
for example is only 12KB (which includes JS/CSS etc everything), so we still
have quite a small built size.</p>

to port that code over as well. Which means we have to have a full markdown parser
in JavaScript, which will further increase the size.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,10,1,6:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>We can do this in a conditional way, only include markup/markdown parser if one
of the dynamically called components need it. Or only include dynamic component
rendering part of JS if there are at least one dynamic component. But even in worst
case I do not see our compressed, everything included HTML going above 20-30KB,

a general purpose UI library that can be used with any JS project. We would be

lints</a>, and
I quite liked it. We should have a strict mode in <code>ftd</code> and a regular mode. In
strict mode we fail on any thing that maybe wrong, eg un-used import, variables
or components with improper case, un-used component arguments and so on. We will
try to be as strict as possible. Maybe even bad formatting should be considered
an error in strict mode. All arguments in component definition must come before
the properties for example.</p>

try things out. And finally we should have <code>fpm build --release</code>, which will use
<code>ftd</code> in strict mode, forcing people to ensure all sloppy-ness is fixed before
something is published.</p>

<code>bar.ftd</code>. When evaluating <code>bar.ftd</code> we would include the <code>prelude</code> stuff, so <code>bar</code>
will try to import <code>foo</code>, and we are back to recursion. We could have done some
document analysis, see that <code>bar</code> is importing <code>foo</code> and <code>foo</code> is “special”, so
treat <code>bar</code> too as special and do not do auto import prelude stuff, but we felt
its too magical, and generally did not like it.</p>

folder itself, so we know what documents are special, and prelude can only import
from FPM and not elsewhere, but it too was too much magic. And there was also a
risk that it may bring every document in <code>FPM</code> folder due to transitive
dependencies.</p>

The idea is any package can act
as a package interface, and then any number of other packages can implement that
package interface, and all packages implementing a given package interfaces can
be used interchangeably.</p>

file. Actually this was so till a while back and when Arpita was creating a package
interface for slides, she created a bunch of documents, <code>slide-1</code>, <code>slide-2</code> and
so on.</p>

making package index the “main” place which contains all the symbols exported by
a package, but we can still define them in separate files, so <code>index.ftd</code> does
not become too big.</p>

Why did we feel a need to bring everything together into
a single <code>index.ftd</code> instead of importing different modules? Because of our package
aliasing. When defining a dependency we have <code>as &lt;alias&gt;</code> syntax to make it easy
to alias the package and then use the package name as a single word from any
module.</p>

DocSearch</a> widget.
DocSearch provides an integrated search experience, a library to fetch data from
backend, in this case Algolia, and a UI with autocomplete, Command Palette
interface and so on. It’s great as as drop in implementation.</p>

core search feature. There are many alternatives,
<a href="https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/features.html">MeiliSearch’s</a>,
<a href="https://typesense.org">typesence</a>, even ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL Full Text

there is a function <code>search(query)</code> available in JavaScript that can initiate

So I have been thinking about <code>fpm update</code> recently
and came across <a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/nostr">nostr</a> that implements something
very close to what I had in mind.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,2:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>I kind of consider <code>nostr</code> design the right design, good balance between
centralised (prone to attacks, censorship etc) and “pure” peer to peer (complex,
less reliable etc). Maybe there are issues, but to me it sounds good.</p>

What is missing is package identity. Package
names depend on DNS if you buy your own domain, and with others, eg github if you
host on <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code> etc. So how do we ensure you really own the package
identity? That you can move from <code>.github.io</code> to something else without losing
people who may be interested in your content.</p>

But this relies on
old service still running, often companies come and go, domain can expire or sold
to someone with no interest in honouring the old contracts.</p>

One candidate is cryptographic keys. But they are too
hard, at least when you are targeting billions of publishers, like Twitter and
Facebook does. Eventually your FPM packages should be your twitter/Facebook
profile, but how do you manage identity?</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,6:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>WhatsApp etc, E2E, End To End-Encryption systems rely on some shared identity, eg
a phone number of email address as a convenience, and then they generate some keys
behind the scenes, you can see the fingerprint of your keys in whatsapp for
example, and verify each others identity (phone number appears to be the identity
from the layman’s perspective, but its backed by strong cryptographic foundations).</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,7:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>So let me repeat, when you are sending a message on WhatsApp, you think you are
sending it to a phone number, but WhatsApp has internally exchanged some encryption
keys with that contact, and its going to that key.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,8:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Let me say it in a more formal way, in PKI, whatever that might be, anyone can
generate a key pair, a private key and a public key. This key pair can be
considered an identity. When you send a message it goes to someone, that someone
needs to be identified, and how we identify them can be considered their identity.
What you can do is encrypt the message with the public key of the recipient, and
only the corresponding private key can de-crypt the message.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,9:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>So in this sense, a key pair can be your identity. But key pairs are just numbers,
and unlike phone numbers, they are much bigger. So exchanging these numbers is not
fun, it’s opaque, no one can remember them, nor can see what they are referring to
if we see a huge number representing a public key in someone’s <code>FPM.ftd</code> file as a
dependency.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,10:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>So we need a way for the key pair to get an alias. The domain name is a good alias.
If we tread DNS as alias, not the source of truth, things are much better. Identity
moves are rare, but they do happen. People switch providers, people may want to
move from Github Pages to another service, and back. Once someone starts following
someone, such moves should not affect them, the followers should continue to get
updates despite name changes. So how do we achieve this with PKI and aliases?</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,11:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Imagine Github Pages implemented our protocol, this is how it could work. They
generate a key pair for you when you sign up. This is important if we want
billions of people to use services. Most people are not going to want to bother
with all this. This is what WhatsApp/Telegram do to deliver strong cryptographic
guarantees (at least by design/promise, implementation is another matter) to
masses.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,12:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>So when you create an account on any of these services, they create a new unique
identity (key pair) for you. You start using that service, you gain followers,
and say you get serious. This is the point you will bother with all this identity
business details. Now you have say 100s of followers and you want to move to a
different provider, without losing the followers (without breaking 100s/thousands
of packages that depend on breaking).</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,13:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>At this point you will now claim your identity. You install another app, offline
only for strictest guarantees, and generate your real identity, real key pair.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,14:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>Now if Github Pages etc are acting in good faith, they will let everyone know that
they are temporary guardians of your identity, that you have not yet claimed your
identity, and the moment you do so they will cooperate. If they chose to act in
bad faith, charge you money for you to claim your identity or not let you do it
while initially promising that they will, then you could lose follower, but
hopefully word will spread and people will shun such services.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,15:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>So the temporary guardian of your identity can accept your real identity keys,
and everyone who is following your via <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code> now learns of your
true identity as well (and that Github is an intermediary working for you for now,
via you signing the Github generated keypair with your real identity).</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,16:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>So real identity has always been the keypair, but we would be using the domain
name. We need a distributed store of keypair to DNS mapping, so you can switch
the domain for your keypair. Some sort of “key server” is needed. Your followers
where initially thinking that the Github generated keypair was the true identity,
but since you update your identity, github will notify them about the true
identity and your FPM will now store the true identity of what you are following.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,17:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>We also will have to allow for “key revocation”, say one of the guardians went
rogue, got bought out, hacked etc, and starts sending updates on your behalf to
your followers, you had signed that key-pair with your key, so now you have to
revoke that key-pair. The key-server can do that as well.</p>
</p>
<p data-id="0,0,0,18,1,18:main-container-external:0:main" style="border-radius: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; white-space: initial" class="ft_md"><p>So the protocol is: in <code>FPM.ftd</code> you see domains. You keep a cache of domain to
keypair id on your file system. Periodically you check with key-server if the
domain for any keypair has changed, if so <code>fpm</code> commands start reporting warnings
that domain entries are out of date, please update ASAP. <code>fpm</code> can now chose to,
if you so want, start using the latest entries from key-server for the
identities, so say if dependencies say you are publishing on
<code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>, but since <code>key-server</code> says domain moved to
<code>&lt;username&gt;.com</code>, <code>fpm</code> will start fetching from <code>&lt;username&gt;.com</code>.</p>

can use another theme visually compatible with your theme, or create your own.</p>

want push, as soon as the package we are interested in is updated, say I opened my
laptop for a few minutes before catching a long flight, I would want my system to
automatically fetch all the latest updates. If in the last minute before I close

few hundred, thousand maybe “central” agents. Say there is a new component
<code>fpm bastion</code>, probably using that word incorrectly, some sort of <code>fpm aggregator</code>,
and say each package can pick say 10 of such aggregators. People can maintain fpm
aggregator lists, some will be available via <code>fpm.dev</code>, but say its down, under
attack, sold out, there are others lists, and each package may include a list of
aggregators they know of so one can look at all aggregators from all the package
they currently have.</p>

with each other. For each package they keep track of the <code>FPM.ftd</code> file. We can
always use public key infrastructure to ensure the <code>FPM.ftd</code> file I receive from
an aggregator is trustworthy (they can lie about not giving me the latest update,

happened. Aggregators may even be paid to give guarantees that they talk to
everyone or that they have strong latency guarantees (the gap between an update
happening on any aggregator in world to this aggregator telling you it has
happened).</p>

aggregator for this package. We can also do the aggregator push, like my preferred
aggregators are say this list, then when I am fetching a package from your
<code>fpm-repo</code>, I can tell the repo about that list, and tell <code>fpm-repo</code> to notify to
one of my preferred aggregators.</p>

First is the
tried and tested, i18n approach, say we use <a href="https://projectfluent.org">Mozilla’s
Fluent</a>. We can define special strings we have in our
source code, and we invest in comprehensive translation so no one has need to
improve it (meaning it can not be done by writing FTD files, you must recompile
<code>fpm</code>).</p>

we know about, but what about themes and other kind of content people create? Say
a theme for book (document interface) will have terms like “table of content”, how
to centrally translate such information so that each user of that document
interface in that language doesn’t have to keep deciding how to translate things.</p>

short versions, like <code>integer</code> instead of <code>int</code>, or <code>language</code> instead of <code>lang</code>,
since we believe things are written once and read many many times, and we have
immense capability in getting confused. How many people can guess <code>gu</code> stands for
Gujarati and not some African language? What have we really saved by writing <code>gu</code>,
instead of writing “gujarati” which has to be written precisely once in the
package which is probably going to have tens or thousands of words?</p>

One we must ensure the language names are exactly the
same, we all call it either “Gujarati” or “gujarati”. This is because we can then
easily re-use translations etc, standardisation is good in general.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">Wikipedia</a> (or find out
where did they get the actual data from). They have mapped more than one names to
same code in a few cases, which I feel is actually a good thing, we can be more
precise in language name, honour the preference of the author, we are interested
in the code, which we will get.</p>

should show. But the translation status page we should show probably both ગુજરાતી and
Gujarati.</p>

information, should we allow both somehow? Say <code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી</code>, we
will ignore the part after <code>|</code>, so that can be used as some sort of description
about the translation.</p>

someone translated it into “Rust Programming Language for Advance Haskell
Programmer”, it will remain in English, but the audience has changed, advance
Haskell programmers probably do not need such a laborious, long explanation, maybe
their book would be just a 10 page book instead of the 100 (random guess) page
current book?</p>

population who wanted to read it but could not because of language barrier. But
isn’t a book written in too much (or too little) technical detail a language
barrier itself? Can you read a book written for absolute beginner of a topic if you
are in advanced stage, and vice versa? Can these two people really talk to each
other meaningfully? Isn’t there is a need for a translation there?</p>

does, shouldn’t there be a document like this? Which assumes you know everything,
and you are only interested in exact description of precise behaviour of what FPM
does? Of course that document must exist. But is that just a document? It must be
a package right? And then we have the “end user documentation” of FPM. Isn’t that
just a “translation” of the formal spec?</p>

First part must be
language name as per ISO 639-1. But when allowing or disallowing we will use the
entire value of <code>language:</code> key. So you can not have two translations with
<code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી</code>, but you can have one with
<code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી</code> and other with <code>language: Gujarati | ગુજરાતી (simplified)</code>.</p>

there is a question of coverage - not all features of <code>fpm</code> could have been used

store the <code>.html</code> file, we just stored the corresponding dynamic context, <code>fpm.ftd</code>

smaller diffs. I guess I just trying to reduce the amount of code review I have to

folder during build, and how we can sometime download just the <code>FPM.ftd</code> for an
FPM package instead of downloading the entire package <code>.zip</code> file. It sounded like
a great idea, and Arpita implemented it right away, and she did one better, she
included some extra data also in the <code>FPM.ftd</code> file.</p>

package meta data and make it part of the published <code>FPM.ftd</code> file. We can show
number of files or word count of the package, we can include LICENSE, even sitemap,
latest snapshot versions etc etc. We can anticipate a lot of need, and most of the
“metadata” needs of <code>fpm</code> can be satisfied by putting data in <code>FPM.ftd</code>.</p>

file in the package. With this idea, of making lot more data available to <code>FPM.ftd</code>
that becomes even more interesting.</p>

<code>FPM.ftd</code> is now downloadable, without having to download the entire FPM package)
is that for many cases we will not have to download full package, eg when
specifying translations, when a FPM package is specifying the translations, we only
specify the package name, the actual language of the package is part of <code>FPM.ftd</code>
meta-data of that package, and she used to have to download the entire FPM package
zip file just to get the language (so she can show it in the translation dropdown).</p>

step close to changing a theme should be just one line change (its a bit harder
than other systems where theming is well defined, you always know what you are
theming, Wordpress support Wordpress themes, which only work for blogs, and say
Winamp supports Winamp “Skins”, which only works Winamp, you cant use Winamp skin
with your Wordpress blog for example[1], with FPM you all sorts of UI, music
player to Browser, to pricing page to Resume etc can all be “themed”, and we want
cross portability across all of them “as long as it makes sense”: follows the same

a music player theme in their blog? Say you are discussing the UI of the
player, say you want to show how the UI works, what would you do? Take a
screenshot? And you call that action of a sane mind? What will happen if that
theme changes? Are you going to come back and update the screenshot? <em>That</em>
would be lunacy my friend. Just import the FPM package for the Winamp theme,
pass the data that Winamp would have passed it (if we were living in the world
where people are not, you know, insane – creating UI in platform after
platform, even more insane where UI of one “framework” on same platform can’t
use UI of another frame, I am looking at you JavaScript, with your framework
pared – and using FPM for example), and now you blog post contains always
refreshing, true, intractable Winamp screen. FPM makes it possible. Why would
you not?</p>

design. We do not want a single central infrastructure in FPM like they have in
other languages, eg <code>crates.io</code> for Rust or <code>npmjs.com</code> for Javascript and so on.
Centralisation has many problems, censorship becomes easy, single point of attack
for bad players, difficulty with confidentiality (what if you have some
information you do not want to leave your company VPN etc), bureaucracy (you can
not get a new feature on crates.io till you go through whatever hoops that there
to work with their team: I am sure they are very responsive etc, but they cant be
as responsive as your own self hosted repo, that you can tweak and deploy hourly
if you wanted to).</p>

distribute packages to be downloaded once at build time, when you are doing a
deploy, you will download the <code>.zip</code> file from package repository, and won’t
download again till another dependency is added or version changes. No end user
goes to <code>crates.io</code>/<code>npmjs.com</code> etc.</p>

So FPM repository is used by
all end users, and all your site traffic goes to your <code>fpm-repo</code>. One single
website or a company can not host the entire Internet (live traffic, not like
<code>Archive.org</code>).</p>

give load balanced deployment with support for Edge caching, some other may focus
on Math related computation etc. FPM and FTD has a lot of dynamic features, and
that means there is a lot of play in features offered, pricing and business models
and so on.</p>

package naming, so wanted to write down my thoughts about them. Currently all
packages in FTM are distributed via Github. In short future ~ Jan-Feb 2022
timeframe we should also have <code>fpm-repo</code> that can be used for publishing packages.</p>

But the
distinction, if something is self hosted or on some package repository should not
exposed to users of package, so authors should easily move their package from
self-hosting to SAAS or back without breaking anything.</p>

expect the package to specify <code>repo: github</code>. We also have <code>domain</code> setting for
each package, so domain name can be considered as part of a package, if we did that
then the published version of package may include some information about how to
fetch the source version of package, so in dependency it would be enough to give
the package name, (with domain name as part of package name).</p>

finally we got FPM working with custom Google Fonts (any font for that matter

The problem is Font is not
a simple file. Since we have a lot of languages, we can not embed symbols for all
characters in all languages in a single font file, as that would become a large
file and would slow down websites (and waste CPU/battery/bandwidth). Similarly many
fonts design regular font face, italics, bold etc separately, previously people
used to just algorithmically slant the characters or make the font bold by
thickening the lines, but for best effect font designers create custom design for
one or more/all characters for each font style. So we can not put regular, bold,
italics etc in one file as well, as that too will be wasteful.</p>

face etc, and let browser download the font they need based on the content of the
current page.</p>

won’t cut it. The easy way to fix was suggested by Sourabh to allow people to pass
URL of CSS file, eg Google Font recommends something like this:</p>

it in the page. This does solve the problem, its easy. But it has a problem: it
allows people to now provide arbitrary CSS file, there is no way to check the
content of the target file to ensure it only contains <code>@font-face</code> declarations, it
can contain any CSS, and it becomes a way for people to include CSS in FTD files.</p>

that’s it, those attributes will have equivalent in Android/nCurses etc, or we will

targets. We believe CSS is over designed etc, and so is JS. We can create a browser
from scratch without CSS/JS overhead, which is capable of rendering FTD files, so
even for browsers we do not need the whole thing. We can maybe even use canvas API
to use such custom rendering even for current HTML based browsers.</p>

Like say you are an intern and you want to join FifthTry, you will have to learn
Rust, but then also Diesel, and PostgreSQL. And yes Django. And possibly even Elm.
Some JavaScript. Some CSS. And of course enough about Linux, and AWS? And this is
assuming they do not have to learn any FifthTry specific stuff. Which they still
have to. What is FTD? How we deploy our services, how we do things and so forth.</p>

of versioned packages is that “translation can not alter logical content” rule.
Consider <code>1.0/intro.txt</code> vs <code>1.1/intro.txt</code>. Consider a question: who decides if
<code>1.1/intro.txt</code> must exist? Original package only, or can translation package also
decide this? Is it possible that in original we only have <code>1.0/intro.txt</code> and no
<code>1.1/intro.txt</code>, which means as per the maintainers of original package, who
supposedly are working closest with the actual software being translated, as per
them there is no need for <code>1.1/intro.txt</code>, that there is no software change between

maintainers take overwrite this call and still decide to have <code>1.1/intro.txt</code>?</p>

not only translated but decided to expand the intro and cover more topics in the
intro? If they do then original and translated intro have logically diverged. It
would then not be accurate to say that this is just a translation, it is not an
independent work which was derived from the original.</p>

one should be aware when they are doing it. Some authors may be okay with their
work being translated “faithfully” in other languages, but may not like their work
editorialised or “improved upon” by others (and sold / marketed in the original
author’s name). I as an author may not be able to read how you have altered my work
in Chinese or some, so how can I as an author endorse it? I don’t even know what’s
in it, maybe the change is minor but its really hard to say what is minor and what
is not. A little thing the translator decided to omit as its too early to mention
this feature, maybe the reason people would not buy that product because the author
knew that that feature must be mentioned earlier as author knows the audience
better than the translator.</p>

work. And authors should be allowed to say they are okay with strict translation

There is one exception tho: what if say you
are also maintaining a “translated glossary”. This document may not exist in
original, but in every translation one must maintain a document that lists what’s
the translated term we are using for each interesting technical term in the
original language. If we start from scratch, two different translators can pick
two different ways to translate a term, and that may not be good for readers. So
this document should be present, and one can argue every document in the translated
package should be tracking the glossary file.</p>

It looks for status of all documents in original package by reviewing content of <code>.track</code> and shows status for each file like “Never Marked”, “Update Date” etc.</p> <p>TODO: Arpita to give me sample output of the command.</p> <p>She has also implement fallback based build: if <code>django-hi/intro.ftd</code> doesn’t exist we look for <code>django/intro.ftd</code>.</p> <p>Next: We will build <code>fpm mark-upto-date</code> to keep updating translation status.</p> <p>We also discussed if django has N dependencies do we auto include them in <code>django-hi</code> if <code>django-hi</code> is a translation? Or should each translation mention each dependency explicitly? For translation we may want to use the translation of a dependency instead of the original package, and while doing so we would need to be able to rename and keep using the same name.</p> <p>Next we also have to add <code>language</code> in <code>fpm::Package</code>, and ensure that key is set if current package is <code>translation-of</code> some “original package”. Original package must also have the <code>language</code> set and the languages must be different. Also <code>translation-of</code> can’t be “chained”, if this package is a translation of some other package then no other package can translate this package, everyone must translate the same package, each translation “cluster” has a single original translation package that every package in that cluster is translating.</p> <p>Finally we need to come to UI. We have a few scenarios, say translation doesn’t exist for some document, in which case we have to show a message on top saying you are seeing the English version because this document is not yet translated in Hindi. Similarly we need UI for “never marked”, “out-of-date” and “upto date”.</p> <p>We want people to be able to control these messages, these messages themselves must be translated. We will have files <code>FPM/{missing, never-marked, out-of-date}.ftd</code>, if they are not present we will have some fallback message. When creating a new translation using a future <code>fpm create-translation</code> command we will auto create these files maybe.</p> <p>In never-marked and out-of-date scenarios we will have three FTD files to build, which will go in the generated <code>.html</code> file. The “message” file will show on the top of the page, and then one of the two, original and translation, would be shown and the “message” file will have a button with an <code>$event-click$: call-js &lt;function-name&gt;</code>, and we will have FPM.js file, which will have functions <code>show-original</code> and <code>show-translation</code> (and a “client variable: <code>fpm.showing-original</code>).</p> <p>We will also need other server variables to be used when building “message” file with variables like <code>original-language</code>, <code>translation-language</code>, <code>translation-status: &quot;never marked&quot; etc</code>, <code>original-marked-on-date</code>, <code>original-latest-date</code>, <code>original-diff</code> etc.</div></div>

ask why no <code>x.ftd</code>? Are we allowing <code>x/index.ftd</code> to be referred to by <code>x</code>? No. Our

level, we follow <code>x.ftd</code> and <code>x/y.ftd</code> convention and do not fall back to
<code>x/index.ftd</code>, <code>x/y.ftd</code> as say node etc do. There are advantages to fall back, eg
whole of <code>/x/*</code> is in a folder <code>x</code>, this leads to some simplicity, eg if you want
to ignore that path, you have to no ignore <code>x/</code> folder as well as <code>x.ftd</code> file.</p>

extension. Does that mean when you want to refer to <code>x.ftd</code> anywhere in FPM context
it must be <code>x</code>? Like on command line if you want to add tracking on <code>x.ftd</code> or sync
<code>x.ftd</code> do you use <code>x</code> or <code>x.ftd</code>?</p>

statement, you can not import a <code>.txt</code> file, but you can track <code>.txt</code> file, so if
only <code>.ftd</code> is allowed for something we use the path without <code>.ftd</code> extension and

strictly means it is a FTD file, where as file means any file. So function names,

Say you have a <code>logo.png</code> file, there can also be a
<code>logo.png.ftd</code> file which contains the meta data or web index of the <code>logo.png</code>. We
can argue that this is too much complexity and lets have no such special
convention. For example this causes another complexity as to what should be the URL
of such <code>logo.png.ftd</code> file? The URL of <code>logo.png</code> is <code>/logo.png</code> if it is at
package root, but for <code>x.ftd</code> the URL is <code>/x/</code> so with this logic the URL of
<code>logo.png.ftd</code> would be <code>/logo.png/</code>, and having different content based on
presence or absence of a trailing <code>/</code> in URL seems to be a bad idea. Or maybe we do
it based on “accept” header, if you request an HTML for <code>/logo.png</code> you get the
content of <code>logo.png.ftd</code> and if you request image you get the <code>.png</code>. But then how
would you link to the file? Say you want to open an image in a new tab?</p>

abstraction and frameworks. I kind of am not fond of them, unless there is a strong
reason. It like a trade, you want to have a nice Mercedes, sure, go ahead, you just
have to pay for it. You cant just wish it. If you want to create a framework you
have to understand all future needs. You have to educate people, it must be well
documented. There must be abstraction boundaries. Everyone must understand what
this framework is doing etc etc. People look at framework and go say I will also
make one. But I will do all the work later. If you wonder where tech debt comes
from, this is where it comes from. You went to a Mercedes showroom and drove off
with a shiny car, and told them you will pay for it later. Live with your
“bailgadi” instead.</p>

Also instead of framework - a
full on abstraction over file system, as that is what the <code>fpm::document</code> module
is trying to be, an abstraction over file system so you do not have to deal with
file system API - we should think of use cases and write helper methods.</p>

We need to know if the given path is ftd document or
markdown or some static file. Further want to know if some path is top level,
in-fact there is only one such use case, we only do one special handling, the
top level <code>index.ftd</code> maps to <code>index.html</code>, every other <code>.ftd</code> maps to
<code>&lt;without-extension/index.html</code>. Further during processing we want to report
relative path of every document being processed, with respect to current directory.</p>

package root directory or any random path inside it. We want to support the later
case so none of the function should be written with respect to the assumption that
they are running from package root directory. Either that or we assume everything
is running from package root and we do a chdir at the start of the program. If we
do change directory then we still need to keep track of which directory we were
called from so that during reporting we show the relative paths.</p>

translation, we want to walk the original package and find corresponding files in
current package. That too we would want to do starting from an arbitrary folder, eg
the folder corresponding to current dir in the original package (eg if package root
is <code>foo</code> and you are in currently in <code>foo/a/b</code>, and original is <code>foo-en</code>, then we
want to traverse all files in <code>.packages/foo-en/a/b/</code>).</p>

things can become a problem if the package size or complexity grows. With support
for HTTP request handling and SQLite queries, and we will be adding a lot of stuff,
we are just getting started, the time it takes <code>fpm build</code> may start becoming an
issue.</p>

has no change. Consider the simple case, <code>a.ftd</code>, which does not import any other
document. Consider also we do not have dynamic features like <code>fpm.now</code> which
returns the current time. In such cases, we can choose to not rebuild <code>a.ftd</code> if
the content of <code>a.ftd</code> hasn’t changed.</p>

store this information, and use it when to decide if we should rebuild things or
not. Eg, if we know some document has used <code>fpm.now</code> and has no other dependency and
that document’s content hasn’t changed, we still want to regenerate the
corresponding html, as <code>fpm.now</code> returns a different value on every run.</p>

used. If the sqlite database file has changed then we need to rebuild the document
that queries that sqlite database even if the document itself hasn’t changed.</p>

would be creating/updating based on the content of all documents in an fpm package,
that sqlite will always change, and any document that queries that package database
can never be cached.</p>

we have a sqlite file, and some document is only interested in instances of that
record, and we know that only a few files have created an instance of that record,
now the out of date graph would be a lot smaller, only those few files.</p>

tables in different database join may not always be possible (not sure how things
would be after the support of referring multiple sqlite databases for a single
query, can it negate this drawback?). Not sure how foreign key would work etc.</p>

databases as well, and do it opportunistically, only generate the databases that
were referred by any of the documents. This way we can even choose to not generate
the big package database if no document is querying that database.</p>

Say <code>package a</code> wants to query
database of <code>package b</code>? That is slightly simpler because then you are not worrying
about build time but sync or publish time. It may be okay to do more work during
publishing.</p>

package or any package that is a direct dependency of this package. In fact, if
current package depends and a package <code>a</code> and <code>a</code> depends on <code>b</code>, then we must not
allow current package files to directly reference files in <code>b</code> without adding an
explicit dependency on <code>b</code>, as while this is technically not a security issue, it
causes issues if <code>a</code> removes the dependency, the package will suddenly stop
building.</p>

documentation are not logical. Eg, if the original documentation said this function
takes three arguments and the new one says it takes four, this is a logical
difference. But if the original documentation was too terse, and new documentation
gives more examples and explanations and how-tos, the documentation hasn’t really
changed in a logical sense.</p>

We know refactor, should not cause any change in
behaviour of the software. But in software it’s really hard to arrive at this

will really have no effect, that it’s safe to merge.</p>

doesn’t copy, but that’s a git’s internal detail, from human operator/user
perspective it is a copy), we must have a single folder with all versions, one
folder for each version. But when creating a new version, we must not copy content
of the current version, we must create an <strong>empty</strong> folder and rely on fallback
logic at documentation build time to fill in the files from the last versions.</p>

file is <strong>logically</strong> divergent from the corresponding file in the previous
version. One can even store just the diff, and maybe that is what we will end up
doing, but from data structure perspective thinking as if we have only stored the
diff is the right way to think about what I am suggesting.</p>

copies would go down, and humans can easily review if the change is indeed logical.
For that matter, humans may also realise that the change in the software itself
can be tweaked so this logical change is not needed (I mean if you are changing
something you are forcing every user of your library to learn something new, and
if with a small amount of effort you can ensure that no change is needed, no need
for hundreds and thousands of users to learn something new, isn’t that small effort
worth it? And it’s not just users you are helping, if you have to maintain one less
diverged file, it will reduce the overall work you have to do in the lifetime of
the project while maintaining the highest quality documentation).</p>

actually, umm, not sure what word to use, not buggy per se, but kind of not as
useful as I first thought it would be. It converts only the text field to

converted to <code>serde_json::Value</code>. I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/blob/53492bb14f16983569184f0acfd9c1f45ddf1c32/src/library/sqlite.rs#L102-L108">simple converter for other

implement “ad hoc tracking”, basically a <code>.track</code> folder that contains <code>foo.track</code>

this it means two things.</p>

missing or not up to date, we have to include the content of both (and two

would be populated by URL query parameters, URL fragments (eg <code>username</code>) here, or

    /*
        fpm-ui.dark-mode behaviour:

        fpm-ui.dark-mode is a boolean, default false, it tells the UI to show
        the UI in dark or light mode. Themes should use this variable to decide
        which mode to show in UI.

        fpm-ui.dark-mode-follow-system, boolean, default true, keeps track if
        we are reading the value of `dark-mode` from system preference, or user
        has overridden the system preference.

        These two variables must not be set by ftd code directly, but they must
        use `$event-click$: message-host enable-dark-mode`, to ignore system
        preference and use dark mode. `$event-click$: message-host
        disable-dark-mode` to ignore system preference and use light mode and
        `$event-click$: message-host follow-system-dark-mode` to ignore user
        preference and start following system preference.

        we use a cookie: `fpm-dark-mode` to store the preference. The cookie can
        have three values:

           cookie missing /          user wants us to honour system preference
               system-light          and currently its light.

           system-dark               follow system and currently its dark.

           light:                    user prefers light

           dark:                     user prefers light

        We use cookie instead of localstorage so in future `fpm-repo` can see
        users preferences up front and renders the HTML on service wide
        following user's preference.
